Imagine a (literal) stack of plates.  If the stack gets too high, it might topple.  Therefore, it real kife, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold.  Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.  SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
Follow up: Implement a function popAt(index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
