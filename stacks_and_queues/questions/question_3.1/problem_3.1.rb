I really don't understand why this is a dificult question.  I am using both Ruby and JS and both of them
use dynamic array sizing, maybe this is less trivial in languages where arrays are sized in a static format.
I would partition a large array into thirds and have the heads intialized at indexes 0, size/3, and size 2/3.
overflows could be handles in a resizing of the array.
