Question 1.6
given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.  can you do this in place?

Note: the two languages I'll be working in are ruby and js.  I am not sure of the importance of the 4 byte size of the pixel - perhaps for bit manipulation?  I will just treat the image as an nxn matrix and rotate its elements by 90 degrees.
