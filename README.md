# cracking_the_coding_interview

I'm currently reading 'Cracking the Coding Interview'.  Ruby is by far my strongest language, so i am attempting each algorithm challenge in Ruby.  I'm also trying to increase my JS chops so I'll include a JS solution as well.

I haven't completely refactored for O(n?) space and time but i'll try to go back over solutions optimizing for both.
